# Basic Concept and Purpose of Linear Regression

Linear regression is a statistical technique used to establish a linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. Its purpose in machine learning and data analysis is to create a mathematical equation that predicts the values of the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables.

# Implementing Linear Regression with Scikit Learn in Python

To implement a linear regression model using Python's Scikit Learn library, you need to import the necessary libraries, load the data into a Pandas DataFrame, define the independent and dependent variables, split the data into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function, create a linear regression model object, fit the model to the training data, and make predictions on the test data.

# Purpose of Splitting the Dataset and its Contribution to Model Performance Evaluation

Splitting the dataset into train and test sets is necessary to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model. This contributes to preventing overfitting and enables the model to generalize well to new data. The training set is used to train the model, while the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance and check how well it can generalize to new, unseen data.
