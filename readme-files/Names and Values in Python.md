# Names and Values in Python

In Python, mutable data types are those whose value can be changed after they are created, whereas immutable data types are those whose value cannot be changed after they are created.

Some examples of immutable data types in Python include numbers, strings, and tuples.

On the other hand, some examples of mutable data types in Python include lists, dictionaries, and sets. 

It's important to note that even though immutable objects can't be changed, operations on them can create new objects.

Understanding the difference between mutable and immutable data types is important when working with Python, especially when it comes to passing values as arguments to functions or assigning them to variables.
