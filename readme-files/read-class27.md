# Purpose and Structure of Django Models:

> Django models serve as the data structure and database schema representation. They help create and manage the database schema by mapping Python classes to database tables and allowing developers to define fields and handle relationships between tables.

# Features and Customization of the Django Admin Interface:

> The Django Admin interface offers a user-friendly interface for managing database data. It provides automatic CRUD operations, search/filter capabilities, built-in forms, and access control. It can be customized by modifying admin.py, creating custom admin classes, customizing templates, and registering custom views or URLs.

# Components and Workflow of a Django Application:

> The key components of a Django application include models, views, templates, and URLs. The workflow involves the client sending a request, the URL mapping to a view, the view interacting with models and rendering templates, and the rendered HTML being returned as a response to the client. These components interact by views accessing models, templates utilizing view data, URLs mapping to views, and models defining and handling data operations.
