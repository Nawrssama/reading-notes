1. Three key features introduced in ES6 that improve upon the previous version of JavaScript are:
   - Arrow functions: They provide a more concise syntax for writing functions, with automatic binding of the "this" keyword and implicit return statements.
   - Template literals: These allow for easier string interpolation and multiline strings, enhancing readability and simplifying complex string concatenation.
   - Destructuring assignment: It enables extracting values from arrays or objects into individual variables, making code more concise and readable.

2. Utility classes in Tailwind CSS serve as pre-defined CSS classes that provide specific styling utility. They offer a low-level approach to styling, allowing developers to apply granular styles directly in HTML elements. For example, to add padding and background color, you can use the utility classes "p-4" and "bg-blue-500" respectively.

3. Next.js, a popular framework for React-based web development, offers several advantages:
   - Server-side rendering (SSR): Next.js allows rendering pages on the server before sending them to the client, improving initial load times and enhancing search engine optimization (SEO).
   - Automatic code-splitting: It splits the JavaScript bundles into smaller chunks, allowing for faster page loads by only loading the necessary code.
   - Built-in API routes: Next.js provides an easy way to create serverless APIs within the same project, simplifying backend development.
   
   In comparison to traditional client-side rendering, Next.js's server-side rendering approach offers faster initial rendering, better SEO, and improved performance on slower networks. Traditional client-side rendering relies on JavaScript executing on the browser to render the page, which can cause slower load times, especially on low-powered devices or slow internet connections.
