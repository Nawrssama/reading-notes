# What are the key differences between classes and objects in Python, and how are they used to create and manage instances of a class?

In Python, a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects, while an object is an instance of a class. Classes define attributes and methods that objects of that class will possess. Objects are created from a class using the constructor method, and they can be managed using methods defined within the class.


# Explain the concept of recursion and provide an example of how it can be used to solve a problem in Python. What are some best practices to follow when implementing a recursive function?

Recursion is a programming technique in which a function calls itself to solve a problem. 
A common example of recursion in Python is the calculation of the factorial of a number. 
Best practices for implementing a recursive function include defining a base case, 
ensuring that the function eventually reaches the base case, and minimizing the number of recursive calls.
example :


    def factorial(n):
        if n == 0:
            return 1
        else:
            return n * factorial(n-1)



# What is the purpose of pytest fixtures and code coverage in testing Python code? Explain how they can be used together to improve the quality and maintainability of a project.

Pytest fixtures are functions that provide reusable setup and teardown code for tests. 
Code coverage is a measure of how much of a codebase is covered by tests. 
Together, they can be used to ensure that tests are comprehensive and that code changes do not introduce new bugs. 
By using fixtures to set up test environments and measuring code coverage, developers can identify areas of code that need additional testing and ensure that changes do not reduce test coverage.
