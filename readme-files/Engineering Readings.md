# What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?


Identify my skills and strengths: Think about the skills and strengths that I possess that set me apart from other job candidates. This could be my technical abilities, my creativity, my problem-solving skills, my communication skills, or any other qualities that make me stand out.

Understand the employer's needs: Research the company and the position I am applying for. Consider what skills and qualities they are looking for in a candidate. Think about how my unique qualities and strengths align with their needs and how I can contribute to the company's goals and objectives.

Be confident and authentic: When I am able to identify my unique qualities and strengths, be confident in what I bring to the table. Be authentic and showcase my genuine passion for the job and the industry. 


# What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?


Take a break and come back later: Sometimes, stepping away from a problem and taking a break can help me come back with fresh eyes and a new perspective. Taking a walk, doing some exercise, or just taking a few minutes to do something unrelated to coding can help clear my mind and give me a mental break.

Break the problem down into smaller parts: When faced with a complex problem, it can be helpful to break it down into smaller, more manageable pieces. This can make the problem feel less overwhelming and help me identify specific areas where I need to focus my efforts. I can then work on each part individually and gradually build up to a solution for the whole problem.
