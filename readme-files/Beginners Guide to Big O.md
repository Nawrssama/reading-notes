# Beginners Guide to Big O


## Time complexity and space complexity are concepts used to analyze the performance of algorithms.

Time complexity refers to how long an algorithm takes to run as the size of the input data set increases. It is usually expressed using Big O notation, which describes the upper bound of the worst-case scenario. In other words, it describes the maximum amount of time the algorithm could take to run as the input size grows.

Space complexity refers to how much memory an algorithm uses as the size of the input data set increases. It is also usually expressed using Big O notation, which describes the upper bound of the worst-case scenario. In other words, it describes the maximum amount of memory the algorithm could use as the input size grows.

Analyzing the time and space complexity of algorithms is important because it helps us understand how efficient they are and how they scale as the size of the input data set grows. This allows us to make informed decisions when choosing algorithms for a particular task, especially when dealing with large data sets.
