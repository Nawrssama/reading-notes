# The key components of the Django framework are:

> Models: Define the data structure and interact with the database.

> Views: Handle user requests, fetch data from models, and render templates.

> Templates: Define the structure and layout of the web pages.

> URL dispatcher: Maps URLs to corresponding views.

> Forms: Handle user input and data validation.

> ORM (Object-Relational Mapping): Provides an abstraction layer to interact with the database.

### These components work together to facilitate rapid development, maintainability, and scalability of web applications.

# Django's MTV (Model-View-Template) architecture separates the concerns of handling data (Model), processing user requests (View), and rendering the output (Template). In a typical web request-response cycle:

> Model: The view interacts with the model to fetch or update data from the database.

> View: The view processes the user's request, performs business logic, and prepares the necessary data.

> Template: The view passes the data to the template, which renders the HTML to be sent back to the user's browser.

> This separation of concerns allows for cleaner code organization, promotes code reuse, and makes it easier to modify and maintain different components of the application.
