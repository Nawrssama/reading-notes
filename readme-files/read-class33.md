# The primary purpose of JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) and how they work in terms of encoding and decoding data

>The primary purpose of JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) is to securely transmit information between two parties in a compact and self-contained manner. They are commonly used for authentication and authorization purposes. JWTs consist of three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature. The data in the header and payload is encoded using Base64Url encoding, and then they are concatenated with a dot ('.') separator. Finally, the signature is created by encrypting the encoded header, payload, and a secret key with a cryptographic algorithm. This signature can be used to verify the integrity and authenticity of the token when it is received.

# Integrating JWT Authentication with Django REST Framework to secure API endpoints

## JWT Authentication can be integrated with Django REST Framework to secure API endpoints by using the djangorestframework-simplejwt library. The key components involved in this process are:

>Install the djangorestframework-simplejwt library.

>Configure the authentication settings in Django's settings.py file.

>Define custom views for token-based authentication, including token creation and token refresh.

>Include the authentication classes and permissions in the desired views or viewsets.

>Use the generated JWTs to authenticate requests by including the token in the request headers or query parameters.

# Limitations of Django's built-in runserver for production environments and alternative server options for deploying a Django application

## Django's built-in runserver is not suitable for production environments due to its limitations in terms of performance, reliability, and security. It is designed for development purposes and lacks features required for a production-ready server. Some of the reasons why runserver is not recommended for production include:

>It is single-threaded and not optimized for handling multiple concurrent requests.

>It does not support advanced production features like load balancing, process management, and auto-restart.

>It may expose sensitive debugging information, which is a security risk.

>It is not designed to handle heavy traffic or provide efficient caching mechanisms.

## For deploying a Django application in a production environment, alternative server options should be considered, such as:

>Gunicorn: A widely used Python WSGI HTTP server that can handle concurrent requests and provide better performance.

>uWSGI: Another popular server option that supports multiple protocols and can interface with various web servers.

>Nginx: A powerful web server that can act as a reverse proxy in front of application servers like Gunicorn or uWSGI, providing additional features like load balancing, caching, and SSL termination.
