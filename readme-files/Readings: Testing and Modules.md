# 1   he key principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Python are:

Write a failing test: Write a test case that fails because the feature doesn't exist or is not working properly.

Write the minimum amount of code: Write only the code that is necessary to pass the test.

Refactor the code: Once the test passes, refactor the code to remove duplication and improve its design.


# 2   The if __name__ == '__main__':
 statement in Python scripts is used to define a block of code that will only be executed when the script is run directly as the main program, and not when it is imported as a module by another script.

# 3   Recursion
 is a programming concept in Python where a function calls itself repeatedly until a certain condition is met. In other words, the function solves a problem by breaking it down into smaller sub-problems, solving each sub-problem recursively, and then combining the results.

# 4   In Python, 
a module is a single file that contains Python code, while a package is a collection of one or more modules that are organized in a directory hierarchy. Overall, modules and packages are important concepts in Python that allow you to organize and reuse your code effectively.
