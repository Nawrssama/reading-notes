# Use an Analogy:

>A graph is like a social network, where individuals (vertices) are connected through relationships (edges). Just like how friends are connected on a social network, vertices in a graph can be connected to each other through various relationships.

# Explain a Detail in Depth (DFS):

>Depth-First Search (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores vertices deeply before backtracking. It starts at a vertex and visits its adjacent vertices recursively until it reaches a dead-end. Then it backtracks and explores other unvisited vertices. DFS is useful for exploring paths and finding connected components in a graph.

# WHY, WHAT, HOW Structure:

>WHY: Graphs are used to represent complex relationships between entities and solve problems such as network routing, social network analysis, and recommendation systems.

>WHAT: A graph is a data structure with vertices (nodes) and edges that connect the vertices, representing relationships or connections.

>HOW: Graphs can be represented using adjacency matrices or adjacency lists. Traversal algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) can be used to explore or search through the graph.

# Tutorial / Walk Through an Example:

>Consider a social network where vertices represent individuals and edges represent friendships. You can use a graph to represent this network. Start with a vertex representing yourself and add edges to your friends. Then, explore the graph using BFS or DFS to find friends of friends or to search for a specific person within the network.
