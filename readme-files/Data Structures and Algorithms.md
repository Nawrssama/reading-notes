# What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

when selecting a data structure to solve a particular problem, it is important to consider the specific operations that will be performed on the data, and choose a data structure that has efficient time complexity for those operations. This can help to ensure that the program performs optimally and scales well as the amount of data grows.


# How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

Define a base case: A base case is a condition that stops the recursion from continuing.

Ensure that recursive calls move towards the base case.

Control the input size: It is important to ensure that the input size is controlled and limited so that the recursive calls do not continue indefinitely.
