# Key characteristics of serverless computing:

> Serverless computing abstracts the underlying infrastructure and allows developers to focus on writing code without managing servers.

> It is event-driven and scales automatically based on demand.

> Billing is based on actual usage rather than a fixed server capacity.

> It provides rapid deployment, high scalability, and reduced operational overhead.

# Differences from traditional server-based architectures:

> In serverless computing, developers don't need to provision or manage servers, whereas traditional architectures require server management.

> Serverless computing scales automatically, whereas traditional architectures often require manual scaling.

> Serverless computing is event-driven, while traditional architectures typically rely on a client-server model.

# Getting started with Vercel and deploying a serverless function:

> Sign up for a Vercel account at vercel.com.

> Install the Vercel CLI (Command-Line Interface) on your local machine.

> Create a new project or navigate to an existing project directory.

> Use the Vercel CLI to deploy your project by running a command like vercel --prod.

> Configure your project's settings, such as environment variables and domain aliases, using the Vercel dashboard.

> Create a serverless function within your project, for example, in the /api directory.

> Deploy the serverless function by running vercel --prod or pushing changes to your Vercel repository.

# APIs (Application Programming Interfaces):

> APIs are sets of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate and interact with each other.

> In Python applications, APIs can be utilized to access and manipulate data from external sources, such as web services or databases.

> APIs provide a defined interface through which developers can send requests, receive responses, and perform operations like retrieving, creating, updating, or deleting data.

# The Requests library in Python:

> The Requests library is a popular HTTP library in Python that simplifies making HTTP requests and handling responses.

> It provides an elegant and user-friendly API to interact with web services and APIs.

> The library supports various HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc., and provides features for handling cookies, headers, authentication, and more.

## Example of a basic GET request using the Requests library:

    import requests

    response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')
    if response.status_code == 200:
        data = response.json()
        # Process the received data
    else:
        print('Error:', response.status_code)

> In this example, the get() function from the Requests library is used to send a GET request to the specified URL. The response is then checked for a 200 status code, indicating a successful request. If successful, the response data can be processed further. Otherwise, an error message is printed.
